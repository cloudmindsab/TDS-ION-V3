# TDS-ION-V3
A powershell repository for partners and resellers to TD SYNNEX.

Important information for reseller will not be provided in this repo.

Resellers and partners that want to use the V3 API's need to activate account in the portal.
Account will not work before activation is approved by ClouOps.

Resellers with interest of using our api's to do Lifecycle management of products, can use my set of code to get started.

In this first release, powershell will be released first, then I will release Python examples as well

## Get started
