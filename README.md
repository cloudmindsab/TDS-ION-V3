# TDS-ION-V3

author: Nicklas Karlsson - Platform Manager TD SYNNEX Nordics

A repository for partners and resellers to TD SYNNEX.

Important information for reseller will not be provided in this repo.

Resellers and partners that want to use the V3 API's need to activate account in the portal.
Account will not work before activation is approved by ClouOps.

Resellers with interest of using our api's to do Lifecycle management of products, can use my set of code to get started.
In this first release, powershell will be released first, then I will release Python examples as well

## Get started

I use postman to collect and create my requests. Then I translate requests to powershell and python.
if you want to recieve updated postman collection for total management, give me a ping. The fundamental postman collection and environment .json files can be found here in the postman folder.

## Dig in the data

## Automate execution with Azure Automation 

## Push data to Azure Sql Database

## Use Azure Logic Apps

## The use of Microsoft PowerPlatform
